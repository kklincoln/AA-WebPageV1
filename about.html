    <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
        <p>While not at work, some of my hobbies include weightlifting, photography, reading philosophy, exploring new cities and cafes, and cooking recipes I encountered that strike inspiration. 
        Each of these hobbies aid in development of traits that benefit my employment performance as well.
        For instance, weightlifting has fostered a level of discipline, grit, and perseverance required of someone in any technical role. With the requirement of grit with consistent upskilling and learning; perseverance and discipline required to be implemented within debugging investigations to resolve bugs; and the awareness and perseverance to understand that even if today's implementation is resolveed, there may be a larger -and potentially more problematic- challenge tomorrow.
        Photography also aids in personal development, through altered perspective allowing to see a more optimal solution through a different approach, creativity which correlates to UX, and the ability to decrease cortisol and stress through self-expression.
        </p>
        
    <h2>Framework Preferences</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Software Engineer</li>
                    <p>
                        Building Full-stack applications:
                    </p>
                <li>Data Analyst</li>
                    <P>
                        Within the scope of Data Analyst roles, the tools typically used included Microsoft SQL Server, SSIS, MS Visio, PowerBI and Excel; Tableau; Python, and Jira.
                        When traversing through the process of data import, cleansing, analysis, governance as well logging, many tools tend to achieve similar results in terms of either presentation or analysis and are therefore interchangeable.
